This folder will contain education resources for teaching microcontrollers/arduino. Course will be split into 10 sessions which will cover elementary
information about physics (electronic circuits, passive components, ohm's, kirchoffs' law, non linear components, transfer functions), informatics
(functions, variables, global and local scope, simple algorithms), mathematics (trigonometric functions, finding inverse functions, ...) and then we will
focus on important stuff related to microcomputer hardware / software design (reading schematics, electrical components, communicating protocols, microcontroller
pins, pwm, adc, timers, interrupts, generating sound, measuring various variables like temperature, humidity, pressure..., wireless transmission). Extra part
will show example how to make a PC program that communicates with arduino board, and example how to control the board wirelessly using android phone.
