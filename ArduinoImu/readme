9 dimensions of freedom IMU

This project connects to 9DOF module from www.geeetech.com (also known as Razor 
9DOF), this module can be flashed with Arduino tool, because it has also 
some atmel microcontroller incorporated. For visualization of informations from
3 axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, I decided to use html+javascript.
This time I wanted nice graphical representation of device position/alignment,
so I used the WebGL technology for the first time.

For interfacing serial device to web browser, a proxy utility is necessary,
proxy.cpp can be compiled in visual studio as terminal application.
