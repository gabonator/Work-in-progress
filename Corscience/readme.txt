I will place here my experiments with medical equipment, when I was looking for some resources and datasheet about these products, I wasn't able to find something useful. So I decided to place everything here, currently there are two applications - boso blood pressure meter and corscience EMB1 two channel ecg device.
Both devices utilize the corscience protocol that implements custom packeting and crc algorithm, everything is implemented in C++ and should be easy to recycle the code for any other corscience device.
